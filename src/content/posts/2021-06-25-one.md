The internet can often feel like a polluted city. A place overrun with the noise of ads and a shortage of fresh air. It's not that popular sites have no value, or that the web is broken. It just feels like it could be so much better.

We contend that the missing piece is you. Your voice, your perspective, your genius. To increase its inherent value for the world, the web needs you, and it needs to give you the means to create a presence owned by you that is secure by default, capable of scaling from an audience of one to a million.
